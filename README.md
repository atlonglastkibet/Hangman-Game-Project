## **Hangman Game - Kenyan Towns & Cities Edition**

This Python implementation brings the classic Hangman game to life with a twist: the hidden words are names of Kenyan towns and cities. Players guess letters, try to uncover the word, and have a limited number of attempts before losing the game.

- **Attempt Limit**: Players are allowed a maximum of 6 incorrect guesses before the game ends.
